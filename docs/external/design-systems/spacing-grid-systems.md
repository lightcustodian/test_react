# Spacing and Grid Systems for Enterprise Design

## Spatial System Fundamentals
- A spatial system provides rules for measuring, sizing, and spacing UI elements
- Promotes consistency, reduces design decisions, and improves team communication
- Recommended base unit is an 8pt linear scale with 4pt half-steps

## Grid System Principles
- Column grids help organize content into vertical columns
- Modular grids create matrix structures for layout organization
- Baseline grids establish consistent vertical rhythm

## Layout Scaling Strategies
1. **Adaptive**: Completely different experiences per device
2. **Responsive**: Fluid layouts that adapt across screen sizes
3. **Strict**: Fixed layouts maintaining specific interactions/legibility

## Key Implementation Considerations
- Start small by converting simple components like buttons
- Demonstrate value to stakeholders by showing time savings
- Maintain momentum with clear milestones
- Align design and engineering teams on implementation approach

## Critical Principle
"Uniformity on a spatial level allows your product to be more consistent, your team to communicate better, and reduce the number of decisions designers have to make in a day."

The goal is creating a predictable, trustworthy design system that scales effectively across different platforms and devices.
